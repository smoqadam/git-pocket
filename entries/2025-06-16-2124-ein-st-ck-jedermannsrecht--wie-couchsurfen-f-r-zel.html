        1NITE TENT</p><p></p><p>(one night tent) works like Couchsurfing – but outdoors. Are you the owner of a beautiful spot on Earth and want to share it? Then mark the location on our map #NewSpot. Outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, and hikers can access the spot online and camp there for one night – without any exchange of goods or services.</p><p></p><p>Rules</p><p></p><p>One Night! The spots are meant for an overnight stay during your journey, not for a week-long free camping vacation! Pre-registration required. Most spots are located in people’s home gardens. Please contact the hosts in advance to let them know you’re coming. Of course, they have the right to decline if it’s not a suitable time for them to accommodate guests. If you’re arriving with a camper van or similar vehicle, please ask for permission in advance. Some places may not have space for it or the hosts may simply don´t like it. The overnight stay is offered without any exchange of goods or services. If someone asks for money for your stay, please report it to hallo@1nitetent.com. No advertising! The contact information of the hosts is strictly for overnight stay inquiries. Requests for promotional purposes are legally prohibited.</p><p></p><p>There are many ideas on how we can improve 1Nite Tent – both from us and from you. To help us implement them faster, your support through PayPal or bank transfer is appreciated.
